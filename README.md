RadEdit
=======

RadEdit is a Model View Controller framework
for Node.js with a built-in web-based IDE.
Users can make changes simultaneously, and
when they save, affected pages refresh and
affected tests re-run themselves. It also
works in mobile browsers.


Be a Collaborator
-----------------
Our target feature set is pretty big, and we
can't do it without some help. If you want
to be a part of the framework that's going
to make teams of Node.js developers 10x more
productive, email sameubank at gmail.

Let's do this!
